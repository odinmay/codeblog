# CodinWithOdin

This is my django project for my website www.codinwithodin.com where I do my best to explain Python
programming concepts and go over concepts in a way that is accessible and easy to follow.

This website is being updated all the time, I am writing new articles and restructuring as needed. I would like 
to make the information thorough but not too hard to follow. Most of my posts are accompanied by a Google Colab Notebook
that can be used as an interactive guide through the post so you can experiment and test the code to see results and 
become more familiar with writing code yourself and level up your programming!

### Visual style 
The website is designed purely with readability in mind. I don't want it to be cluttered with ads, I want the information
to be the primary focus. This is reflected by a standard look and feel on the site with a "no-nonsense" approach.
The site is built with Django and Bootstrap.
